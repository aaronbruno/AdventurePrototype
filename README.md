A simple adventure game based on a simple adventure game engine by [Adam Smith](https://github.com/rndmcnlly).

- **2+ scenes *not* based on `AdventureScene`**: LogoScene, Intro, Outro
- **2+ methods or other enhancement added to the adventure game engine to simplify my scenes**:
    - Enhancement 1: unsatisfied (name the method and explain the use of it).
    - Enhancement 2: unsatisfied (name the method and explain the use of it).

Experience requirements:
- **4+ locations in the game world**: CCTVRoom, Tunnel, ResearchLab, SupplyCloset, EscapeDoor
- **2+ interactive objects in most scenes**: Examples- door, chicken, knife, computer, ID card, dog and stranger
- **Many objects have `pointerover` messages**: door, chicken, knife, computer, ID Card, dog and stranger
- **Many objects have `pointerdown` effects**: door, chicken, knife, computer, ID Card, dog and stranger

**Asset Creations:**
All assets were created by Aaron Bruno with the exception of the sound/music being edited in Audacity. The sound and music files had their treble and bass adjusted, as well as having their pitch changed so that I got the sound I desired.

The "Rubber Ducky Entertainment" logo text, rubber ducky art, and main menu art were created in Adobe Photoshop.
